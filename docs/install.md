A complete `melrose` installation requires:

- Installation of Microsoft Visual Studio Code
- Installation of the extension `melrose-for-vscode`
- Installation of the `melrose` console application

## Install from source

Instructions to get the source, install the runtime dependencies and compile the program, is documented in the [README](https://github.com/emicklei/melrose) of the project.

## Install from package

Due to increased restrictions and costs of releasing non-commercial packages for the Apple Mac OSX and Microsoft Windows plaform, I can only provide unsigned packages for Apple Mac OSX. 
Contact me (see github) if you want a commercial, signed and supported version.
