# Install

## Mac OSX

The tool `melrose` requires an external dependency (portmidi) that needs to be installed first.

    brew install portmidi

See [Brew](https://brew.sh/) for instructions on how to install `brew` on your Mac.

See the [PortMidi](https://sourceforge.net/p/portmedia/wiki/portmidi/) for alternative installation instructions of `portmidi`.
