## Install from package

Due to increased restrictions and costs of releasing non-commercial packages for the Apple Mac OSX and Microsoft Windows plaform, I can only provide unsigned packages for Apple Mac OSX.

### Mac OSX

[Using Melrōse with Apple Garageband](https://emicklei.github.io/melrose/garageband.html).

Contact me if you want a commercial, signed and supported version.

## Install Melrōse plugin for the free Visual Studio Code editor

You can install the extension directly from your running Visual Studio Code Editor or by going to the [Marketplace published package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EMicklei.melrose-for-vscode)

## Install from source

Instructions to get the source, install the runtime dependencies and compile the program, is documented in the [README](https://github.com/emicklei/melrose) of the project.
