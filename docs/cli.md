# Melrose

The command-line tool `melrose` is a Read‚ÄìEval‚ÄìPrint Loop (REPL) that produces or consumes MIDI. 
By entering statements using the [language](dsl.html), `melrose` will send out MIDI messages to any connected [DAW](daw.html).

Commands to control the program itself are prefix with a colon `:`.
With `:h` you get list of known functions and commands.

## API server

Melrose starts a HTTP server on port 8118 and evaluates statements on `POST /v1/statements`.
The port can be changed to e.g. 8000 with the program option `-http :8000`.
This server is used by the `Melrose Plugin for Visual Studio Code`.
