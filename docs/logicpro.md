###### Logic Pro is a product of Apple Inc.

## Goal

Logic Pro is a professional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) available for Apple Mac OSX.
Melrōse can communicate with Logic Pro by exchanging MIDI messages. Logic Pro has a rich set of sounds and instruments to play MIDI notes. In addition, Logic Pro is able to play multiple MIDI channels simultaneously which can be programmed individualy by melrōse.

This article describes the steps to get Melrōse working with Logic Pro such that you can play your melody per-channel.

### Installation

The installation steps are mostly the same as described for [GarageBand](https://emicklei.github.io/melrose/garageband). Follow this article and close the GarageBand application after completing it. 

Keep the editor and the `demo.mel` file open.

### Create project

Open the application Logic Pro and create a new project.
Go to the project settings and enable de-multiplexing of MIDI messages.


### Add Instruments

For the demo, we are creating two tracks with 2 different instruments.

### What's next

Visit the [Melrōse documentation](https://emicklei.github.io/melrose/) to find information about the programming language and the program itself. It also offers tutorials, examples and recorded demo videos.

Happy music coding!
