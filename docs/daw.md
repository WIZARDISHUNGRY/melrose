# Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)

`Melrﾅ行e` itself does not produce any sound.
Instead, it sends MIDI messages to connected hardware or software, such as a DAW.
There are many open-source and commercial products that provide synthesized sounds for many software instruments.

We have tested `Melrﾅ行e` with only a few such products:

- [Using Melrﾅ行e with Garageband](https://emicklei.github.io/melrose/garageband.html)
    - no support for multi-channel tracks
- Logic Pro X (commercial)
    - with support for multi-channel tracks
- FL Studio
- LMMS
