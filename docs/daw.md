# Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)

`melrōse` itself does not produce any sound; instead it sends MIDI messages to connected software, such as a DAW.
There are many open-source and commercial products that provide synthesized sounds for many software instruments.

We have tested `melrōse` with only a few such products:

- Garageband, available for Mac OSX
    - no support for multi-channel tracks
- Logix Pro (commercial)
    - with support for multi-channel tracks
- FL Studio
- LMMS
