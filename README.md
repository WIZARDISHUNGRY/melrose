|----------|-------|-------------
| C4       | ¬ºC,C,c  | quarter C octave 4 
| 2E5      | ¬ΩE5,¬Ωe5 | Halftone (2 x ¬º) E octave 5
| 1C       |        | Full tone C octave 4
| F#       | F‚ôØ,f‚ôØ  | F sharp
| G_       | G‚ô≠    | G flat
| G.       | G.    | duration x 1.5 
| =        | =     | quarter rest
| 2=       | ¬Ω=    | half rest
| 1=       | 1=    | full rest
| D+       | d+    | quarter D octave 4 MezzoForte

# Melrose Live Coding

Using the command-line tool called `melrose` and a MIDI controlled synthesizer.

## language

### variables

Variable names must start with a non-digit character and can zero or more characters in `a-z A-Z _ 0-9`.
An assigment `=` is used to create a Variable.
To delete a variable, assign it to the special value `nil`.

### composition functions

Functions create or augment musical objects. 
Objects cannot be changed after creation.
Each function returns a new object or an object wrapped in a function.

### audio functions

These functions control the audio device (playing, changing settings).

## help

          join --- join two or more musical objects
          note --- create a Note from a string
      parallel --- create a new sequence in which all notes of a musical object will be played in parallel
         pitch --- change the pitch with a delta of semitones
        repeat --- repeat the musical object a number of times
       reverse --- reverse the (groups of) notes in a sequence
      sequence --- create a Sequence from a string of notes
        serial --- serialise any parallelisation of notes in a musical object
     undynamic --- undynamic all the notes in a musical object

         bpm --- get or set the Beats Per Minute value [1..300], default is 120
          go --- play all musical objects in parallel
        play --- play a musical object such as Note,Chord,Sequence,...
      record --- creates a recorded sequence of notes from device ID and stop after T seconds of inactivity

      :h --- show help, optional on a command or function
      :l --- load memory from disk, optional use given filename
      :m --- show MIDI information
      :q --- quit
      :s --- save memory to disk, optional use given filename
      :v --- show variables, optional filter on given prefix
