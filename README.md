## Note notation

| Notation | Alternative | Description 
|----------|-------|-------------
| C4       | ¬ºC,C,c  | quarter C octave 4 
| 2E5      | ¬ΩE5,¬Ωe5 | Halftone (2 x ¬º) E octave 5
| 1C       |        | Full tone C octave 4
| F#       | F‚ôØ,f‚ôØ  | F sharp
| G_       | G‚ô≠    | G flat
| G.       | G.    | duration x 1.5 
| =        | =     | quarter rest
| 2=       | ¬Ω=    | half rest
| 1=       | 1=    | full rest


## Sequence notation

| Notation    | Description 
|-------------|---
| C D E F       | 4 quarter tones
| [C E] [d5 f5] | 2 doublets


# Melrose Live Coding

Using the command-line tool called `melrose` and a MIDI controlled synthesizer.

## language

### variables

Variable names must start with a non-digit character and can zero or more characters in `a-z A-Z _ 0-9`.
An assigment `=` is used to create a Variable.
To delete a variable, assign it to the special value `nil`.

### composition functions

Functions create or augment musical objects. 
Objects cannot be changed after creation.
Each function returns a new object or an object wrapped in an operation.

### audio functions

These functions control the audio device (playing, changing settings).
